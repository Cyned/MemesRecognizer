And the fact that the corporate media has been spewing propaganda for Hillary Clinton\n this entire fucking time, I don't think it's the smartest thing to validate that shit by voting her into office. And I'm\n sorry you're such a fucking idiot that you can't comprehend that Hillary Clinton winning the election will bring a huge\n level of passivity to the entire population of America and for 4 more years nothing will get done because she is such a\n piece of shit candidate that we will not take back the Senate. And the truth is economic inequality is out of control,\n climate change is at the Tipping Point NOW, oh yeah Wall Street and the banks are gaining more and more power and\n your solution to that is to elect a Centrist who will get absolutely nothing done but will pacify the populace?! Okay\n retard great strategy. I want Trump to win so I can go kick the living shit out of the Democrats, the corporate media\n and the millionaires and billionaires who Force Hillary Clinton on the population. Along with allowing Trump to set half\n the country on fire so the American population really starts understanding the consequences of elections. I mean I bet\n you are such a fucking idiot that you don't even comprehend that one of the main objectives of the government is to\n put people into a passive position of ignorance, because ignorant people are vastly easier to lead. That's literally been\n the Clintons mo since day fucking one. If we have any hope of changing the government or possibly combating climate\n change to actually save the fucking world, you have to get people out of their apathetic bubble and sadly you need\n extreme examples to do that. Because the real problem isn't with our government it is the fact that our population is\n too docile and stupid to stop it from doing the fucked-up shit that it does. But your solution and that is to elect Hillary\n Clinton okay great job retard.

The\n government is in a panic trying to figure out\n what to do to decide who the next president will\n be. Finally, Barack Obama comes up with an\n idea: a literal presidential race. The three\n candidates would run a lap around the White\n House and the person with the best time would\n become president. Bernie Sanders goes first, but\n being as old as he is, he takes about 24 minutes.\n Trump goes next and arrives with a time of\n 14:26. Hillary Clinton goes last, running as fast\n as she can, trampling the flowers and shrubs in\n her way in an effort to beat Trump's time. She\n finally crosses the finish line at just under ten\n minutes.\n Aha!""

The\n government is in a panic trying to figure out\n what to do to decide who the next president will\n be. Finally, Barack Obama comes up with an\n idea: a literal presidential race. The three\n candidates would run a lap around the White\n House and the person with the best time would\n become president. Bernie Sanders goes first, but\n being as old as he is, he takes about 24 minutes.\n Trump goes next and arrives with a time of\n 14:26. Hillary Clinton goes last, running as fast\n as she can, trampling the flowers and shrubs in\n her way in an effort to beat Trump's time. She\n finally crosses the finish line at just under ten\n minutes.\n ""Aha!"" She exclaims, ""That must be some kind of\n record\n ""I don't think so,"" says Obama, ""Bush did 9:11"

Then the\n others just started jumping in and expressed distaste for him going after Hillary so forcefully.\n We all agreed that no good comes out of party infighting.\n After 20 or so minutes of discussion, everyone in the room agreed that defeating Trump was\n SAVE NOW at WALMART COM\n LEARN MORE\n far more important than sticking to idealism and voting for Sanders. I threw out several\n positive Hillary characteristics to help lessen the blow of releasing their candidate, and we\n talked about the delegate math and there was unanimous agreement that good Democrats\n should vote for Hillary.\n On the way out of the house, one of the former Sanders supporters told me that she had never really seen that mean\n selfish part of him before, and it totally turned her off.

Spat in Bernie's\n face\n That's not to say everyone is at fault. Bernie Sanders was supported by a segment of a young generation that\n believed things could be different. This segment is the same group of young people who never gave in to all the shitty\n pop music and modern culture of dismissing serious issues\n in favor of obsessing over Kim Kardashian and Justin\n Bieber\n I am a member of this segment of the young generation. I am someone who always understood more than\n And yes\n my peers. I have a triple digit IQ and a four digit score. And I've SAT always understood politics. While other kids\n were watching ""Hannah Montana,"" I was watching the ""Daily Show"" when I was only a middle schooler\n e always\n had an instinct for politics\n n 2006, I predicted that Obama would be President before anyone else even had a clue\n who he was. It's for all these reasons that you know I'm not just bluffing when I say that Bernie Sanders was our last\n chance\n this cannot entirely be blamed just on ignorant citizens who didn't stop to learn about Bernie. It is also the\n To be fair\n amount of fraud in this election. And how do I know there has been fraud? Well, I have seen some of it firsthand\n When it was time for my state to vote in its primary, I was excited to be a part of the process. Though I could not yet\n vote, I volunteered my time as a poll watchdog, making sure nothing bad was happening. During most of the voting\n time, nothing seemed out\n of the ordinary. But I stayed late after the polls were closing. That was when I saw a black\n man messing with the consoles. I walked up and asked, ""What are you doing?"" He looked around, saw that nobody\n saying, ""I'm getting paid a lot of money to rig this. But you're a kid so nobody will\n else was there, and leaned in\n believe you anyway."" It was then that I realized just how corrupt this system is\n I'm not sure how I kept my optimism for so long. I guess I just thought even if people didn't believe Bernie, they\n would at least believe the facts. Facts like just how bad income inequality has gotten. Facts like how the American\n people haven't gotten a raise in fifty years. Facts like how the Federal Reserve steals from the poor and gives to the\n rich. And facts like how free trade agreements have led to the collapse\n not growth of a number of developing\n countries\n But despite all of this... today, democracy died. The Establishment lives. And we will all suffer\n Why did this happen? Maybe it was just ignorance. Maybe it was all the women voting with their genitals or because\n t's her turn."" Maybe it was all the African-Americans forgetting their history and who had helped them get their\n rights\n I know you're asking\n but who do you support now?! I don't know. I've seen a glimmer of hope from Jill Stein and\n Gary Johnson. But the truth I would gladly take even\n is, Trump over Clinton. Trump isn't the one under investigation\n Trump isn't the one trying to hide so many secrets. On the contrary, at least Trump is an open book. And frankly\n even if he burns this whole country down, it's probably a faster path to real progressive reform than the kind of\n neoliberal backwards incrementalism pursued by Clinton\n I would say God help us all, but God doesn't exist\n If you want\n to share this, don't hesitate\n You don't even need to credit me. The more people that hear the truth, the\n better\n permalink source embed save save-RES report give gold reply hide child comments"

And that he doesn't know why Hillary Clinton doesn't want to make the time\n to reach a large national audience to inform them about what she wants to do for the county. And why she would\n purposely choose the date that forces the American people to make a choice between watching the final game of the\n series they've been watching al\n month, and informing themselves on the difference between the Democratic\n candidates? Yeah, I guess politics shouldn't be commented on by people who have no fucking idea what they are\n talking about"

It celebrates memes as a higher art form. It will show how they\n have moved a long way from websites such as Reddit and 4chan, and how\n they are used as communication across cultures. It will explore memes as\n an artistic practice that relate to people in a socio-political (Bernie and\n Hilary) and creative (Doge) way. It will include female meme collectives,\n colloquial meme sites, meme archives and gold mines. It will illustrate the\n transition from a simple 'internet meme' to memes that have transferred\n from URL into IRL. They will no longer be viewed as poor taste or low\n culture but portrayed as the most democratic art form, similar to folk art\n Fellow meme appreciators have sent in their favourite memes, or created\n their own, with a caption explaining what a meme means to them. The\n female collective\n are creating meme inspired pants for the\n exhibition, whilst Instagram artists\n and\n s have\n made original memes especially for What Do You Meme?\n The exhibition will raise curatorial questions, as to how something as fluid\n as an ""internet meme' will work outside of the internet, will it lose its\n meaning and purpose IRL? Will the memes included in the exhibition\n become dated as the internet flows on, dropping one thing and picking up\n the next? Will memes ever be taken seriously in the art world? However,\n one thing is for certain, What Do You Meme? will create an insight into the\n world of memes, encapsulating the most dank of its kind\n Above all else What Do You Meme? looks to much celebrate memes as a\n many light-hearted, such humorous part of the Internet that cannot go\n ignored"

It is also often prescribed to treat\n excessive sleepiness in patients with Parkinson's, Alzheimers, and multiple sclerosis, Additionally, it has also gained a\n following among students, truckers, and others who want to stay awake for extended periods of time.\n o Modafinil was developed by the and French firm Lafon was approved by the FDA to treat narcolepsy in 1998. It is now\n sold under the brand name Provigil by the Pennsylvania drugmaker Cephalon.\n o Modafinil gained attention in the medical community because it\n is the first effective stimulant with no significant\n potential for abuse.\n of medications called wakefulness promoting agents; it works by changing the amounts of\n area of the brain that controls sleep and wakefulness.\n certain natural substances in the\n o The precise way that modafinil works is unknown: it seems to slow the release a GABA, a sleep promoter in the brain.\n It may also affect the histamine system, which is connected to sleep regulation.\n o It can be used for two or three day stretches at a time, with few known side effects and little risk of addiction\n Provigil's impact on the body is different from other pick-me-ups, which tend to be indiscriminate intheir function:\n it confines its activity to the particular neurological processes connected with wakefulness and does not act as a broad\n stimulant. This is probably why it has not gained popularity as a street drug.\n o Amphetamines, on the other hand, promote wakefulness by causing dopamine to flood to the brain. Dopamine is a\n broad hitter\n it sets the heart racing\n makes\n and the user feel high, impacting the entire central nervous system.\n Caffeine affects a different pathway that deals with the neurotransmitter adenosine, and is also a\n broad stimulant.\n e military, for obvious reasons, is interested in the consequences of prolonged sleep deprivation and has tested\n modafinil heavily, particularly on pilots.\n o A study carried out by the Air Force Research Laboratory found that fatigued pilotson modafinil maintained flight\n accuracy within approximately 15-30 percent of baseline levels, whereas performance under the no-treatment condition\n declined by as much a\n 60-100 percent. Here, benefits were most noticeable after 24-32 hours of continuous\n wakefulness. A French study yielded similar results and found that for missions of about 24 hours, modafinil for soldiers\n is preferable to naps.\n o In the U.S. military, modafinil has been approved for use on certain Air Force missions. The French, British, and Indian\n militaries have all expressed interest in modafinil.\n UNCLASSIFIED US Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. CO5784708\n https:llmail.google.com/mail/caMUMD? ui-2&ik-7e05ccd5d7&view-pt&search inbox &th-1 57b4c14ff69b654.\n 2/3"

If you\n can that is stupid beyond reason. Secondly, where was all the media when\n Obama did the very same thing several times in his career? In fact, he said\n stuff that mothers and fathers normally never talk about. So why wasn't he\n accused of anything? The answer is that the media doesn't care and\n neither should we. Speeches aren't copy written like books are. Speeches\n can also influence a person subconsciously in a way that books don't. The\n conclusion that every logical person should conclude is what is the media\n trying to hide from the uneducated? The answer is Rudy Giuliani and his\n blasting of Obama and Clinton and Mrs trumps overall good speech that\n would have taken away a whole lot of women voters. think the conclusion\n is quite obvious.\n Like Comment\n a Share\n The value of the cent must be lower than Ithought.\n Like Reply 2 hrs"

The majority of people share common traits:\n They have an IQ range of 90\n 110, they aren't curious, they define reality based on social pressure and they are\n highly susceptible to the will of authority, and they are absolutely terrible at novel problem solving.\n While in psych being normal is considered good, any objective analysis shows it's not. Normal means being a puppet\n who is blind to the very visible strings. Look at your world, you have a status quo of various nation states with the\n capability to destroy civilization. A substantial portion of the goods produced and consumed are made by defacto\n slaves. The environment on which basic food supplies relies in is legitimate per\n This world would not exist in such a\n sad state if it wasn't for the fact a typical normal person wasn't so easy to manipulate and so incurious."

You don't get that illegals undermine black communities in particular. you don't get that\n illegals undermine minimum and low wages. You don't get that illegals and legal immigration undermines the effort to\n fix education because, why, you can just import talent from India, et al., for less while illegals simply overload the\n system. You don't get that Mexico is actively trying to load the southwest up with hispanics in order to take it back for\n Mexico once hispanics are citizens and can vote in hispanic politicians with loyalties to hispanics and Mexico and further\n fracture society and our country.

The guy in the first panel isn't trying to discredit the argument that Apple is a morally dubious company. He's pointing out the\n hypocrisy of protesting apple' while using their products\n And it is valid criticism of Al Gore that he flies in a private jet, and it's valid criticism of David Suzuki that he lives in a mansion with a\n carbon footprint which is probably 100 times bigger than my own. Nobody believes that, because of this, what they say about the\n environment has absolutely zero validity, they're just hypocrites.\n reply\n 1 point\n 3 hours ago\n No it's a fallacy, you're assuming their conclusion is wrong because of their actions. Someone can be using meth and claim it's\n addictive and people shouldn't use it, this does not negate the fact that they are right that it is addictive and people shouldn't use it. Or\n they could be wrong about meth, but they're not wrong because they are a user of the drug, they are wrong on their premise of the\n argument and the conclusion they draw\n You can criticize the messenger, but what the person you replied to is saying is that you can't use that criticism of the messenger to\n discredit their message. Just like how Al Gore flying in a jet does not negate the fact that Global Warming is a very real thing. A person\n who drinks and drives and argues for laws against drinking and driving perhaps is a hypocrite, but this does not negate their argument\n that rules should be in place to safeguard the public from intoxicated individuals.

No president wants to see any\n police officer harmed or killed. Period. Iam old enough to have voted for\n Reagan when he ran for his second term and here are some interesting facts\n about police officers killed in the line of duty during that time\n Reagan Presidency-1507 total deaths, 1312 at his seventh year\n Bush (Sr) Presidency -707 total deaths\n Clinton Presidency 1147 total deaths, 1309 at his seventh year\n Bush (W) Presidency 1133 total deaths, 985 at his seventh year. This number\n does not include the 72 officers killed on 9/1\n Obama Presidency-890 total deaths at this point, 803 athis seventh year\n During those 34 years and 5 presidents, Wis the only one I can recall having a\n press conference honoring fallen police officers. And that was on 9/11.Imust\n have missed the other 4544 press conferences held by President Obama's\n predecessors honoring those fallen heroes\n I understand that a lot of people don't like President Obama. But please do not\n vilify him for behaving the same way every president has in our lifetime. He has\n done what each of his predecessors has done: condemned the actions. Look at\n the numbers. Instead ofdamning him for an incorrectly perceived slight, we\n should be praising him for having the fewest number of slain police officers in\n generations\n These numbers are from the National Law EnforcementOfficers Memorial\n Fund website"

If you've ever met someone who is\n completely insufferable, think about the TV tropes they remind you of\n Years ago that person was an insecure eight year old completely\n abandoned by the society\n He is exhausted and frustrated after a long day at school. He feels isolated\n from his peers and schoolwork because he's not capable of following his\n teacher's rigid lesson plan. Each day he is filled with anxiety and dread in\n anticipation of the single half hour the classmates are allotted to socialize.\n Everyone else is so confident and he doesn't seem to fit in\n After School, He is sitting on the couch at home and his parents haven't\n returned home from work. After two hours of watching TV, his parents\n return. They are tired from a day of exploitation, so dinner is brief and the\n conversation is terse. Too poor in time and money, most nights the family is\n content watching TV until bed. The child might do his homework while\n watching TV or he might skip it, who cares guarantee he's not going to\n understand the content so yeah (Modern Family is on and its loud)"

He thinks he ought to act like someone on\n the TV\n abusive and controlling villain\n stubborn and infallible hero\n cool, dgaf cool guy\n Then he goes to school and tries out the character. Because he is literally\n surrounded by children, his strategy works pretty well. He eventually\n completes his mandatory and supplementary education. He then gets a job\n and raises kids (yells at them for doing normal kid stuff like making a mess,\n doing drugs, having sex upstairs). This whole time he is convinced that he\n is the embodiment of shallow Hollywood story morals. His ideas of right\n and wrong, heroic and villainous, etc are determined by capitalists trying to\n sell merchandise at Walmart.\n Then he hits on you at the bar and you (enlightened) think ""WTF who says\n that? this guy can't be real"", but the is.\n So I think that everyone is confusing the memorable movie characters with\n Obama and Clinton's meticulously crafted brands. This is the constitution of\n their political ideology\n If that child had a large and heterogeneous group of friends (ages\n especially), if that child had a family (he had a family but they were too\n bogged down by wage slavery), or some other outlet for socializing, the\n child might have obtained the skills and experiences necessary to be a\n fulfilled individual."

Is it bad that Hillary Clinton has a\n strong support base of black people because of the image they have of Bill Clinton whereas the\n republican base has abandoned Jeb Bush's attempt to use the legacy of George Bush? ls it\n bad that people think Kurt Cobain is a genius whereas the countless bands that mimic him are\n inferior All of these are forms of a ""cult of personality' once we remove the mysticism and\n propagandistic function of the words.

It is here where the true problems lie\n for it is\n through this institution of education where the bulk of opportunity for\n aspiring Americans is born. Education is not just about developing the\n individual or making one smarter, but facilitating and promoting the\n OPPORTUNITY for success.\n America was and is built upon the principle of equal opportunity, yet the\n illusion of that principle has caused a sharp schism within America, one\n that is finally being fully exposed, or rather finally being fully considered in\n the public eye.\n When avenues and access to opportunity become more equalized, I\n believe it will be the first step toward creating a more harmonious and\n prosperous society, one that will not only transcend cultural and stigmatic\n differences, but one that will usher in a new age of American Excellence.\n When America reestablishes the claim that, ""if you work hard enough, you\n be successful"" to apply to all Americans of all upbringings, America and\n everyone in it will be empowered\n\n So your saying that hard work can't get you out of every\n situation?\n Like Reply 10 hrs\n ith no disraspect\n ould claim on the\n contrary.

This brings it all into perspective\n thought you might be interested in this forgotten bit of\n information\n It was 1987! At a lecture the other day they were playing an old\n news video of Lt.

By whom?"" the senator questi oned\n ""By a Muslim terrorist sir"", Ollie answer\n ""Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?\n ""His name is Osama bin Laden, sir"", Ollie replied\n At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't\n pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't.

However, the\n Israelis would not release any with blood on their hands\n The American President at the time, Bill Clinton, and his\n Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, insisted that all\n prisoners be released. Thus Mohammad Atta was freed and\n eventually thanked us by flying an airplane into Tower One of the\n World Trade Center.

In England, it\n was white\n purple and green, the official colors of the Women's Social and Political\n Union started by Emme\n Pankhurst, among others\n According to a history of the National Woman's Party from the Belmont-\n Paul Women's Equality National Monument in Washington, an early\n mission statement for the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage noted\n The colors adopted by the union are purple, white and gold, selected for\n the significance they bear in the work the union has undertaken.

White, the emblem of purity, symbolizes the quality of our\n purpose\n That no designer has claimed ownership of the outfit, a typical morning\n after event, the better to monetize the attention ofthe world, is notable and\n appropriate.

To many, that outfit could be another\n reminder that in the G.O.P. white is always right\n Four years ago, Republicans fretted about trying to diversify their base, in the wake of\n Barack Obama's clear voter mandate. This time around, with Trump at the top ofthe\n ticket, it's obvious that ship has sailed. On Monday night, Melania Trump was a not-so\n subliminal billboard for what's looking like the Trumpian view ofan ideal America\n And if that's the fashion statement she intended to make, it's a very scary one"

Three women a day are murdered by spouses or ex-spouses.

While most of the smaller fry, that could level countries and cities, are still not\n known and smaller objects are harder to find\n we live in a time where the prospect of another dinosaur killer hitting\n us without us having advance waming is growing very small. I point this out to demonstrate what democracy is good\n at. Adam's law of slow moving disasters states that any disaster that we see with sufficient warning time will be\n prevented\n So, what about the disaster posed by a Ceasar? In our modem world, there is absolutely no reason why we can't\n prevent a ceasar However, the biggest edge that Ceasar has in coming to power is the dividedness of the people. Only\n a divided nation can yield way to a dictator People on one side don't even understand the language the other side is\n speaking. That's a major problem\n Take the issue of guns. I'm not a gun owner. I've never held a gun in my hands. I tend to vote democrat. I in the\n live ilicon valley, one of the most left-wing places in the nation. The only time I've ever seen a gun is behind the counter\n hen\n I\n walk into the sporting goods store. Despite all that, I strongly support gun rights\n as an intellectual matter I\n believe in the rule of law, and the second amendment is not going anywhere. America has\n always had mass\n shootings, but for over 200 years, we had a second amendment and mass shootings were not a big enough problem\n that they led to a discussion on gun control. I hate the phrase ""Have a conversation\n anyone who uses it is being\n condescending. ""Have a conversation\n s what Jehovah's witnesses say when they want to speak and they want you to\n listen. I think there is a serious logic fla\n wi\n ith regards to gun control, and I think the liberals are using mass\n shootings as an excuse to do something they want to do anyway and are not using it to solve mass shootings\n So long as liberal and conservative can't even speak the same language, and come from vastly different life\n experiences, this will be how things are, and the situation ripe for a dictator to consolidate power by playing the two\n sides against each other. That's what Senator Palpatine did when he consolidated power and his rise was modeled\n after Julius Ceasar.\n gold reply\n And who are these historians daiming that a Caesar is to inevitably rise?

I\n even go further and give you\n additional ammo to hate us for: we actually are entirely unwayed, b\n anything that has, or come out. Because it means everything to us to stick it\n in your face. I don't care what Trump does, I care that you are upset. Let's\n just be so plainly honest, you still expect that people can could be swayed\n one way or the other over facts, but we can't. All that we care about is that\n you are baffled, incredulous, absolutely beside yourself with condescending\n indignation. We want you to not believe how it could happen, we want you to\n drop your jaw at our collective ignorance. The fact is, we no longer care\n about running things as we do about breaking your spirit. You getting teary\n is worth more to us than anything. So no evidence that Trump is\n incompetent works, because we lap that up. We can't wait\n You're still in the universe where anyone gives a fuck about facts and I'm\n going to break the pretense, dispense with the mask and admit it we don'\n give a single shit what Trump does or does not do, all we care about is that\n you are upset\n And your outrage is priceless. We literally cannot get enough\n It's not about who is best for the country, it's about how can I cast that vote\n to make the bitches I hate most upset\n I ain't lyin about it. You're being silly if you think any of us are in an ongoing\n discussion. We want the worst outcome because your arrogant\n smug, rudeness over what should be the obvious choice was intolerable, and\n it makes our hearts joyous to vote to break yours\n Stop kidding yourself that this is a conversation\n The silent majority are\n ganging up and delighting in schadenfreude at hurting you. Because it\n matters more that you feel it than anything else\n Why do you think 4chan and /pol/ have influence now? It's a collective\n overwhelming denunciation of the Normie. Our parents, our sjw pals, our red\n pill creepy buddies, all of you\n None of this nonsense dissuades us because you are simply signalling that it\n gets to you. You it's true. You're probably living a healthy, balanced life\n Not us. We have abnormal hate, it was long ago locked in. Nothuing gets our\n jollies more than upsetting you\n This is why posting derogatory articles has no impact. This is why insults\n don't register. Trump is going to win and it's not because of an ongoing\n conversation about facts, as if we give any shits about what that man did\n but because we want to see you lose\n We want to see you having a sweet existential crisis. We want your bold\n Hillary facebook posts. We want you confused and angry with your evidence\n and your\n links, and your self righteousness\n Because it's you\n That he would annoy you gets my support. Because you're\n loath some to the core, sick through and through and opposing you and your\n opinion is more to me than anything\n Trump is pretty incidental\n really. Anyone would get my support if thmey\n infuriated you so palpably. That's what you don't grasp when you make\n bizarre counterarguments\n That this doesn't dissuade but embolden our\n energy\n We don't give a shit about being right, we are just dedicated to death to you\n being wrong. Doesn't even have to be logical, we just have to want to see\n you lose more than you want to be right. And in this day and age, gross\n aggrandized schadenfreude wins over any calculated policy discussion, sorry\n pondido"

It's\n Americans like you who are helping to ensure that Mr. Trump becomes the next President of\n the United States.\n our nation is deeply in need of political reform, and a President with the ability to bring about\n dramatic and positive change. Mr. Trump's experience as a business executive, employing\n thousands, balancing budgets, and winning at negotiations all over the world makes him the\n most qualified candidate to restore American greatness\n Mr. Trump is dedicated to putting the interests of Americans first-protecting their jobs,\n boosting their incomes, and defending their rights against those who would violate them.\n His only special interest is you, the American voter. And he will never stop fighting for you.\n Tobias, we are honored to call you a valuable member of Team Trump and to work with you on\n rescuing the future of our country. Supporters like you are the key to realizingour dreams for a\n country where people, not politicians, come first.

2234,HB7QOOi.png,"23 hrs\n Jonathan Rauch: ""Chaos syndrome is a chronic decline in the political\n system's capacity for self-organization. It begins with the weakening of the\n institutions and brokers-political parties, career politicians, and congressional\n leaders and committees-that have historically held politicians accountable to\n one another and prevented everyone in the system from pursuing naked self-\n interest all the time. As these intermediaries' influence fades, politicians,\n activists, and voters all become more individualistic and unaccountable. The\n system atomizes. Chaos becomes the new normal-both in campaigns and in\n the government itself.""\n ""Like many disorders, chaos syndrome is self-reinforcing. It causes\n governmental dysfunction, which fuels public anger, which incites political\n disruption, which causes yet more governmental dysfunction.""\n Assembling power to govern a sprawling, diverse, and increasingly divided\n democracy is inevitably hard. Chaos syndrome makes it all the harder. For\n Democrats, the disorder is merely chronic; for the Republican Party, it is\n acute... Nearly everyone panned party regulars for not stopping Trump much\n earlier, but no one explained just how the party regulars were supposed to\n have done that. Stopping an insurgency requires organizing a coalition against\n it, but an incapacity to organize is the whole problem.

2237,mJBi75k.png,"t's not too hard to answer, Im just preoccupied with\n watching the GOP implode. Police and the military are necessary to\n prevent the chaos of anarchy-duh. Through good laws and training\n changes they can be improved. They should also be brought to\n justice when they commit crimes, just like any other citizens. Part of\n the definition of a state is having amonopoly on the the use of force. It\n is then the people's job to regulate and direct that force in a\n democracy. I don't know what mass shooters think. The US should\n regulate gun ownership at least as much as car ownership. The post\n was pointing out that if we applied Trump's thinking to gender, men\n would be in a lot of trouble, since they commit the overwhelming\n majority of crimes of all kinds and are one of the major threats to\n women and children's health\n hey're rapists, theyre bringing drugs. But some\n men, I assume, are good peop\n Like Reply 1\n Aww see I missed that part. totally ignore American\n politics S0 l missed the reference. It makes a lot more Sense now.\n Also you are aware that anarchism isn't the lack or any rule\n it is the abolishment of unjustified hierarchies and power structure\n Just throwing that out there. was just wondering what liberals\n actually believe, since Ive seen a bunch of anti gun stuff on Facebook\n but none directed at police dispute the fact they publicly executed 3\n people on film last week. It turns out that people can't act responsible\n but some how the state which is made of people can and will self\n regulate itself. IMO that's a pretty crappy outlook on human nature, but\n I'm sure there are believes you think are pretty shitty like totally\n removing the state\n Well dont claim to speak for all liberals, only for\n myself. And it's true, I don't think removing the state is a good idea- we\n removed Saddam and now Iraq has been in total chaos for over a\n decade. The US has problems but I don't think they are impossible to\n fix. I'm sure at least 3 people's lives were saved by police officers and\n other state' actors last week. We're all just people so the system\n never be perfect. It can be improved in countless ways, there are\n plenty of countries we can look to for examples of how to do better l\n don't want go crazy and play Lord of the Flies trying to start over.\n Anarchy is hard to define, because who gets to decide which\n hierarchies are unjustified? Anarchy is inherently unstable and\n therefore chaotic, in my opinion\n US air strike in Syria kills up to 85 civilians mistaken for Isil\n fighters\n A US air strike killed more than 85 civilians, including children, in Syria on Tuesday\n after the coalition mistook them for lslamic State fighter\n GRAPH\n CO UK"

It\n casts a dark shadow over our species and\n challenges our intellect. It quite simply is\n belief in supernatural beings. Some call\n them gods. It is belief without evidence. In\n virtually no other sphere of our existence\n do intelligent people accept the proposition\n of believing without evidence. Some may\n call ancient writings evidence, but that is\n hardly the case. Writings alluding to Zeus\n or Poseidon are no more evidence than for\n current gods. If someone tells you that they\n believe that god has given them the power\n of surgical techniques you will not allow\n them to invade your body without proof of\n this.

Michelle and I join millions of fans from around the world in mourning\n the sudden death of Prince. Few artists have influenced the sound and trajectory of popular music more\n distinctly, or touched quite so many people with their talent. As one of the most gifted and prolific musicians\n of our time, Prince did it all. Funk. R&B. Rock and roll. He was a virtuoso instrumentalist, a brilliant\n bandleader, and an electrifying performer.\n A strong spirit transcends rules,"" Prince once said -and nobody's spirit was stronger, bolder, or more\n creative. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, his band, and all who loved him.\n Trump's statement:\n ""I think I've heard a few songs of his, what was it, pink rain? He called himself 'Prince' even though he\n wasn't royalty, you figure if a guy calls himself 'Prince' he's royalty, but whatever. I've met real princes,\n big shots, wealthy guys; worth a lot very powerful. And they didn't go around singing. Some of them\n wore velvet though. The point is\n they were really princes. So if you call yourself a prince, you ought to\n be a prince. I mean, is it that crazy folks?"""

2429,NfLzViX.png,"At the restaurant I work at we had the misfortune of having a family of Trump supporters come in. There was a father\n mother, on, and daughter or girlfriend of the\n son (maybe both). The mother was a stereotypical suburbs mom with\n the speak to the manager haircut and everything, the father a big old fat guy, the\n son a buzzcut dude with a Trump\n shirt, and the sistergirlfriend a burbsy boring looking blonde. One of our Hispanic servers without realizing what they\n were took their table and proceeded to ask the family what they wanted to order. Immediately the\n are jerks to our\n server. They give quick, disgruntled answers with angry looks at him the whole time. When he asks about the prep of\n their food and the drink types the\n want they are like\n Is there anything I can get you this evening?\n Nachos, Beef, Coke too\n Alright I'll get that going for you guys\n You\n do that\n When he gets back with their drinks the son in Trump shirt scowls at him the entire time and\n even puts his feet up\n on\n the table when our server tries to walk by him. At this point our server gets mad and lets me know he can't go back\n and deal with them for fear of making a\n scene. I go and see what is going on with the table and the family are laughing\n about their interaction with the server and I hear something along the lines of He was looking scared there for a bit\n and the father replied ""That's why the\n lost California way back when."" At this point I've seen enough\n I got to our manager and let her know what happened and she gave me the go ahead to refuse further service to\n them. I walk back and in a cheery customer service tone tell them ""Hello everyone. I noticed you were all being less\n than cordial to our server. I must inform you that this kind of thing isn't tolerated he\n at\n and if you\n continue, I will have to ask you to leave\n Immediately the son stands up and says ""That's bulshit! He's a fucking liar. I\n don't know what he told you but he is probably just mad about my shirt\n I tell him that he didn't have to tell me\n anything because I saw the whole thing from our termin\n and tell him if they\n ontinued being belligerent they'd have to leave. at this point the father just rage quits and s\n targeted by ""That Mexican waiter"" and I was probably ""just some sad libera\n wanting to act tough and\n pick on them\n He then proceeds to tell me to ""Get out of here\n and go get my manager.""\n So I do. I come back with a manager and\n our security guard for the night and tell the\n we're going to get them a to-go bin for their food and that they'll have\n to leave the premises. I tell them ""we here at\n have a very diverse staff and don't tolerate any form of\n mistreatment. We ask that you leave without making a scene."" The family all rage quite and leave their food and soda\n at the table and proceed to start walking out of the building while talking loudly about ""fucking libe\n and ""this place\n f for faggots anyway\n Just before they leave I realize they didn't pay yet and let them know the\n still have a tab. The father says ""I ain't\n paying you shit\n to which I say ""Ok we\n see what the authorities have to say about that."" He gets all red and hastily\n reaches for his wallet and throws a couple of bills at me and quickwalks out the door to his family. I bend down to pick\n up the money and realize he gave me a 200% tip in his shitfit frenzy. Anyway there was nothing else interesting that\n resulted from this. No fight or cops or anything too exciting but damn it felt good to watch those adult babies leave a\n defeated. $30 tip isn't bad either. I just hope they don't try to come back"

That's why I say you really should\n sincerely seek the holy spirit regarding trump. if you rely only on the scriptures and\n your mind, you will find yourself reasoning against what God is doing and who he\n is using. Who knew the scriptures better than the Pharisees? They were\n educated. And they opposed God himself when he showed up\n All I'm saying is Pray about this.

In short: selective breeding.\n Now we all know males currently cause the most hardship and oppression throughout our world today. Some of those\n men are more agressive than others. Be it from nationality, sexual orientation, or even race.\n I know what you're thinking, but wait a minute. I think we can agree that White and Black American men are\n responsible for 99% of domestic abuse, gun violence and drug use. They are the ones we should target first. We start\n in the South and encourage vascectomies or even offer incentives for having them done.\n We could start promoting Asians more in the US as they seem to be peaceful and intelligent. Hispanic men could be\n used for breeding as the offspring would have beautiful, neutral, olive skin. In about 35 years, we would all be one\n united race\n If Black or White men are born, we could inject them with estrogen to cull some of their aggressive behavior. It's\n important to do it early, as they will disrupt girls from learning in classrooms. Speaking of education, we could limit the\n classes males are allowed to access. We could promote manual labor skills to be taught as I believe that is what nature\n intended for men anyway, given their muscle mass.\n Another key thing would be to ban men from serving in government. They've done nothing but ruin life on our planet\n when they had the chance to bring about peace.

2649,sNMOpP3.png,"I like the new reddit tbh\n (self. The Donald)\n submitted an hour ago\n last edited 18\n nutes ago) by\n lan-W (CisWhiteMaelstrom\n C-2][M]\n announcement\n 1) I welcome /r/ EnoughTrumpspam to the front page. Not too long ago, I sent their mod team a PM\n Dil here I offered to publicize them by sending the message out to /r/all\n like we did for AskBernieSupporters and\n Banned FromThe Donald. As negative as they may be, they double our exposure on the front page of reddit\n They also give us exposure in a way that's more varied than pro\n rump propaganda. They make it a discussion or\n a battle of teams. I think that we kinda saturated the market of what/r/a\n [2]\n can get you. When we owned the\n top, we'd only get an extra fifty subscribers or so that day. I think this new dynamic will reach different\n spectrums of people who don't browse\n /r/al\n [31\n much\n 2) It was uncomfortable for me that we got so grizzly and now we get a more fair fight. We turned\n SR s into /r/TheBestofThe Donald D4l We turned sRD into /r/whatsThe Donaldupt\n [51. Our posts about\n SandersForPresident's tendency to go full on white man's burden got them to discourage campaigning to\n anyone but whites and then they didn't get any minority support. We got liberal Swedes to advertise us. We got\n tel into the news. We did some unprecedented standing up for ourselves against the admins. We made\n /r/politics\n S171 We ran out of\n it to the #1 most active sub and don't even get me started on what we did to /n/new\n opponents. We beat absolutely everybody. It's really time to play a new game\n 3) It opens the door for my revolutionary new plan. I don't want to give this one away yet, but I've got\n something big in mind that's gonna change reddit forever and honestly wouldn't have been possible without\n diversity. I love this subreddit but it's not really designed to last forever and ever into reddit's future and we\n probably should have been thinking all the way back since March about how to actually fix the internet. Without\n giving too many details away, my plan is to use diversity to create and promote a lot of new shitlord subreddits\n we busted through the door of /r/a\n [8]\n we can lead and now everyone through it. No shit lord will have have to\n claw their way up to the top like we did, not only because of the algorithm but because a giant Centipede army\n is here to help them. This can honestly be an incredible thing\n I'm optimistic about the future. Reddit's been a SJW pit for WAY too long and the power of defaults and the power\n of longstanding moderation has always stood in the way of a sitewide ideological change. What we've done this last\n few months is big. It's over 200M views big. We've started a legitimate fight over the identity of the internet and the\n ay that shitlords see themselves. In a way, this is bigger than just discussing Trump; it's a movement and upvoting\n the fuck out of high energy memes is a sort of political statement. I'll unveil my big plans later, but I'm actually really\n excited for all this. I'm not only excited for changes to come but I'm excited to do it with all of you. You're great\n people and we're going to do a lot\n 277 comments\n share\n save hide give gold deport hide a\n child comments"

They make sure poor communities\n stay poor just to get their vote. They support criminals committing violence\n against others with a different view and allow them to burn their own city\n down. Then they are no where in sight when it needs to be rebuilt. This is\n what you want to be or vote for than may God forgive you.

It seeks to overcome\n oppression in a holistic manner without neglecting any\n particular axis so that it might be eliminated and\n genuine social emancipation may be realized.

2968,OyxB6tH.png,"Very Dumb Government by Walter Allen Thompson\n Magazine\n It is obvious to me that Donald Trump has a lot to offer. He is smart, rich, and he states what he believes. But I\n was curious what he believed about evolution. To my delight, he said that he doesn't believe in it and for good\n reasons. Evolution is the stupid person's fairy tale and it should never be taught anywhere because the\n theon has no substance. But since I've lost any hope in the political process, I don't think it matters very\n much. But I like the man if only that he employs a lot of people at his businesses. Say what you want about the\n man, but there are a lot of people working because of his efforts. If he doesn't believe in evolution, then itonly\n follows that he believes in a creator or God.\n think he would be better as a benevolent dictator who works for the benefit of the people at large, rather\n than a two-bit politician who destroys the nice lifestyle most of us have enjoyed over that last 70 years. My\n suggestion to Trump is to dismantle all of the principles of The Communist Manifesto that resides in the\n government"" and simply revert everything back in\n the natural law where it resides. Trump isn't perfect, but\n given the other choices, he may be able to do a good job. Putting young people back to work would be a\n blessing in giving them the opportunity to support their families.\n As a former businessman myself, I can appreciate Mr. Trumps achievements. Yes, he had a lot of help from\n his father, but that's the proper relationship a son should have with his father. He just took what he learned and\n took if much farther. I just don't know howthis man can overcome the idiocy of Washington and keep his brain\n intact. We will see, but the current system has too many communist principles hard-wired into the system"

2986,1IEHigd.png,"score hidden] 3 hours ago\n Tell me how I'm wrong.\n I'm using this election to validate my misanthropy and disdain of strangers and my bitterness and my cynicism. One\n out of every two people I meet would vote for Donald Trump for President. How can I take anyone seriously now?\n When a stranger walks up to me, I brace myself, because people, as I've grown older, have come to represent\n pettiness, shallowness, selfishness, laziness, stupidity, sadness, neediness. I\n don't feel like I'm a member of the same\n species when I'm around most people.\n In the face of what this election is revealing about our population, how can I love everyone? What in god's name is\n there to love about huge numbers of Americans these days? Shallow, superficial, mind-numbingly stupid, obese and\n often, completely content to remain so, and sometimes even proud. Why shouldn't I be the shut-in asshole that I've\n become? I just don't want anything to do with people, because they so often let me down or disgust me. I don't\n understand their motivations half the time. I am alienated. I am Holden Caulfield at 32. I just want to live in a society\n where intelligence and its pursuit are valued over one's talent at getting rich (which, in my mind, means you're\n conniving and good at taking advantage of people); e curiosity is everyone's defining characteristic; where you\n don't have to go into every interaction wondering how the other party is trying to take advantage of you; where\n everyone wants to do a good job. As the saying goes, ""There is nothing new under the sun,"" so I'm sure my feelings\n are no different. The masses have always been stupid and small-minded; in every era\n in every place.\n I know that if one out of every two people would vote for Trump, then the other half would vote for Hillary (who I'm\n fine with. I'm smart enough to have not let a smear campaign shape my opinion). And yes, that's a huge number of\n people with whom I probably jive. It's hard, though, in real life. Fifty percent is high enough to make you wonder\n about everybody. I have become disillusioned.\n People who need people are the luckiest people in the world."" That's a\n line from a Barbra Streisand song. It's proven\n true in my experience. If you love people, you have a good chance at being happy your whole life, because there's so\n many of the thing you love. How do I become that person?"

Bush got elected. If that wasn't evidence enough, Trump should now\n be proof of it.\n Our democratic processes have a huge Dunning Kruger problem, which is to say that most people do not know\n anything, so they can't evaluate what policies might work, or whose opinions might count as an expert.\n George W., with Karl Rove as advisor, dipped his toes into exploiting these pools of incompetence. Trump jumped into\n it headfirst\n Here is one way the democratic process can be fixed.\n Unfortunately, to understand this is a fix\n and that a fix is needed the Dunning Kruger effect applies again.

Someone who\n knows only a\n few things cannot distinguish a person who knows 100% of the things, and a person who\n knows only a few more\n things than them\n Our current democratic process is fundamentally\n limited by the\n Dunning Kruger effect, and needs to be replaced by a\n different process that still takes everyone's opinions i\n account, but also accounts for people's different levels of\n competence, and does this without imposing some arbitrary\n and\n biased test of competence\n therefore The only process I know that would do this would require changing elections, from asking the question ""Who should\n numerate all you know whose judgment you trust when it comes to\n asking the question people ead the country?"" to ssues of policy\n This question takes advantage of the Dunning\n Kruger effect. The effect means that you cannot tell who is more\n competent than you, but you can tell who is less This question\n competent. asks people to enumerate people they\n know, except the ones they think are incompetent. Plotting everyone's answers results in a directed graph with cycles.\n You can now walk this graph recursively, e.g. using an algorithm like Google's PageRank.

3104,8yTOfDA.png,"Donald Trump\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n For other uses, see Donald Trump (disambiguation).\n Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman, television personality, author, and politician. Since 1971, he\n has been Chairman of The Trump Organization, which is the principal holding company for his real estate ventures and other\n business interests. He is also the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party in the 2016 presidential election.\n Trump graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Having worked in his father Fred Trump's real\n estate and construction firm\n while attending college, he assumed control of that family business in 1971, later renaming it\n The Trump\n Organization. During his career, Trump has built hotels, casinos, golf courses, the Manhattan neighborhood Riverside South and\n numerous other developments, many of which bear his name, including Trump Entertainment Resorts (now owned by Carl Icahn). He\n has made the Trump name a valuable and distinct brand. His name appears on such iconic brands as Trump Vodka, Trump Steaks\n and the Trump Shuttle. He briefly sought the Reform Party's nomination in the 2000 presidential election, withdrawing prior to any\n primary contests, although he won two primaries after his withdrawal. Listed by Forbes among the wealthiest 400 of The World's\n Billionaires. Trump and his businesses, as well as his three marriages, have for decades received prominent media exposure. He\n hosted The Apprentice, a popular reality television show on NBC, from 2004 to 2015\n On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president as a Republican, and quickly emerged as the front-runner for his\n party's nomination. His platform includes measures to combat illegal immigration, opposition to many free-trade agreements that he\n regards as unfair, often non-interventionist views on foreign policy, and a proposal to temporarily ban immigration to the United State\n from countries with a proven history of terrorism against the United States, until the government has perfected its ability to screen out\n potential terrorists. His statements in interviews and at campaign rallies have often been controversial. with the rallies sometimes\n accompanied by protests or riots\n Trump won the highest number of states and votes in the primaries, culminating with a victory in Indiana on May 3, whereupon his\n remaining Republican rivals suspended their campaigns, and Republican chairman Reince Priebus declared him to be the party's\n presumptive nominee. Several weeks later, on May 26, the Associated Press reported that Trump had earned the 1.237 delegates\n needed to secure the nomination\n fascism\n d Trump\n Trump at a town hall meeting in Derry, Ne\n Hampshire, August 2015\n Born\n Donald John Trump\n June 14, 1946 (age 70)\n Queens, New York City, U.S\n Residence Trump Tower, Manhattan, New\n York City, U.S\n Education\n Kew-Forest Schoo\n New York Military Academy"

""They openly express their dislike of my race,"" Briana Larios, a\n 15-year-old Mexican-American honor roll student who hopes to go to Harvard, said of some of\n her white classmates. Wounded by accusations that she doesn't belong in the country in which\n she was born, Briana is thinking of being home-schooled rather than returning to the high\n school when classes resume.\n ""People now feel that it is O.K. to say things that they might not have said a year ago,"" she said.\n ""Trump played a big role.""\n Flag Share\n 4 Like"

3220,MtnLktu.jpg,"13 hrs Chicago, IL\n Today, my university hosted an event for the xenophobic, homophobic,\n anti-eminist, racist hate speaker Milo Yiannopoulos. Many students were not\n okay with his presence at this institution and made it aware that this event\n should not happen, yet DePaul let it happen anyway About 15 of the students\n who were against the event were able to get in, including myself. We were not\n going to let this event take place. People say the attention we gave is what he\n wanted, it's what he loves. Idon't care. was not going to let this man spew\n hate speech at my college, the place l used to call home. We sat on the stage\n as can be seen in the video. Hateful things were yelled at us by the audience\n which included several students, DePaul College Republicans (the hosts of\n he event), classmates of mine, students from UChicago, and other guests\n They told us that we need to get a job, they called us names like ""cunt,"" and we\n were told Black lives don't matter to name just a few of things that happened.\n The event got out of hand. The hate speaker was fed up with not being able to\n talk and decided to take a trip to see the President of the university. He left and\n the event ended, but many of the speakers supporters, most ofwho are also\n Trump supporters, took their time leaving and continued yelling at us so there\n was a concern about our safety. While we were being safe\n escorted out of\n the building and into a different space, a white man came up to me, pushed\n me in my breasts and called me an asshole. Following this, he punched my\n sister in the face. The police and campus security were standing not 10 feet\n away when this occurred. This man was not put into cuffs and was not held in\n custody. He was let go. This man who assaulted me and another woman was\n LET GO. This is not the only incident of assault that happened tonight. Several\n people got hurt because of violent supporters of Milo Yiannopoulous.\n I was repeatedly told that DePaul was worried about safety tonight, but if the\n university was tru\n worried about the safety of its students\n this event wouldn't\n have happened. The buzz about this event was loud. There is no way DePaul\n was unaware of the issues this event could cause\n DePaul does not listen to its students, DePaul does not care about its\n students. DePaul does not care about me\n DePaul is not my home, and l am not a Blue Demon"

3276,bOBcSFh.png,"just don't see the rampant SJW bullshit that gets talked about.

While I realize this is only my perspective, I\n still think that one can't allow what one views as a\n n irrational movement to force one in another equally-irrational\n direction. Feminism and gender studies have been heavily affecting philosophical thought for almost a hundred years\n now, the only difference is that these days anyone with a biased, unbalanced opinion can jump on the Internet and\n give their movement a bad name, so it seems much more obnoxious. But you CANNOT let something like that be a\n reason to join something like the Trump camp. At the end of the day, you have to be able to objectively consider if\n what you believe is logically sound, or if it's simply a reaction to a\n already flawed way of thinking. If something like the\n SJW ""cult"" is truly wrong, it will be squeezed out of the picture in time. But don't let your perception of something\n Tr\n to"

But before responding, I spent some time\n thinking about how moments like this come to be. A\n person who never saw Friday, whose relationship to\n black culture is tangential at best, uses an app that\n furnishes lots of cute sayings. Maybe she's seen\n dtbyefelicia in a comment on Facebook or Instagram,\n typed by a black woman she knows from college under\n a particularly ridiculous Trump quote. It seems fun and\n harmless, so she starts using it herself and never\n thinks about it again. ""Bye, Felicia"" is no longer a\n pointed moment from a meditation on hood life. It is no\n longer from anywhere. By the time it reaches her, it's\n just something from the internet\n This is what happens when bits of a culture are\n snatched up, repackaged, and separated from their\n context. It's as though people are buying stolen goods\n from a reputable store. The initial crime of theft is\n scrubbed away, hidden behind whimsical fonts and\n bright colors. It is, in essence, the fencing of pilfered\n intellectual property. And it's a key part of how our\n cultural order is maintained. If everyone in America\n started being really honest about how and where the\n language we use came from and how it got here\n where would it end? What else would we have to admit\n was stolen?\n This thought came back to me the other day when l\n heard Meghan Trainor's megahit single NO"" in my car\n It starts with a sung intro setting up the song's\n narrative theme, namely that the dude fixing his face to\n holler at Trainor in the club is about to get all types of\n rejected. In fact, the scrub can't even get a word out\n before she sings, ""But let me stop you there."" Trainor\n delivers this line in a noticeably weird tone. She\n actively chooses to leave off the ""t"" sound in ""but"" and\n replaces the ""th"" in ""there\n with a ""d,"" making the line\n sound closer to bu lemme stop you dere. t sounds\n forced coming from her, as though she were practicing\n a language she just recently learned"

On the fourth week, I came home from school\n early on account of Butch Charleston ruining my\n favorite handkerchief at recess. But the noises I heard from my manor were\n different that day. Peeking in the nearest window, I saw my mother surrounded by dark shapes, Po mamba's back against the glass. His chanting drowned out the sounds of my mother as l\n watched the surging black ma\n with confusion until I realized it was\n a group of men. African men, slamming their cocks into my mother's\n every orifice as she begged for more through two\n throbbing members occupying her mouth. All noise suddenly stopped. Po mamba stepped forward, ripping off the tattered cloth that covered his crotch. An implausibly large penis flopped down between his legs\n which he guided into my mother's bruised womanhood. The other gentlemen continued the chants. After what seemed like hours, Po'mamba released his load which oozed out through the small pockets of empty\n space between her flesh folds and\n his cock. A small speck of his thick semen fel\n from his glands as he exited, landing on the living room's\n priceless ahan carpet. My day was perfect before your appearance\n here Mr. Wilson.

Thousands\n of Republican figures that loathe Donald Trump, understand the\n danger he represents, and privately hope he loses, are publicly\n declaring their support for him. In Illinois our local and state\n GOP organizations, faced with a choice, have decided\n on complicity.\n Our leaders' compromise preserves their personal capital at our\n collective cost. Their refusal to dissent robs all Republicans\n of moral cover. Evasion and cowardice has prevailed over\n conscience.

It looks like you studied European\n history in college, you should know\n not to compare the left in America to\n hardcore socialism and communism,\n because there is no real comparison\n there, that's just right-wing\n propaganda.

4088,UhCJD.jpg,"Some of my thoughts on July 4th after an important conversation with one of\n the students here\n What is the United States of America?\n want to say\n it is the soil, rock, the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada and Appalachia\n that it is the creeks and the Potomac and Mississippi and Sacramento rivers\n that it is redwoods, aspen, tulip and elm trees, that it is the Everglades, the\n bison, bald eagles, quail, the abundant deer and squirrels, that it is the\n Sunrise on the Atlantic and sunset on the Pacific\n But all of this was always, has always been. Before\n ant to say it is the Navajo\n Iroquois, Cherokee, Sioux, Ohlone, I want to\n say it is the people who have always inhabited this land and continue to do\n so. I want to say it is their ethics, their roots in the land\n ant to say it is the resilience in the hearts of black slaves and their\n descendants who have survived and persevered against all odds, in a\n system that is built against them\n l want to say it is the blues and bluegrass\n and rock and roll that originated from African Americans, a true testament to\n spirit and soul\n ant to say it is the strength of the Asian and Mexican and Central\n American immigrants to make a home here amidst hatred and ignorance\n that still floods this country every day l want to say that it is the flourishing of\n cultural diversity.\n But the United States is none of those things. Those things are, in spite of\n the United States. The United States of America is a chokehold. a system\n made by white people for white people, for the rich to stand on the backs of\n the poor, it is mass incarceration of people of color, it is the exploitation of\n the rest of the World, it is corporate greed, corruption, and the brainwashing\n of its population into hatred, racism, sexism, and homophobia. The United\n States of America is a place where someone like Donald Trump has a\n chance to win the presidency in 2016\n I have love for the soil, the songs, the resilience ofthe people who have\n always been here, the strength of oppressed communities to keep on\n existing and pushing to make things better.\n I wish to express my gratitude\n that I can dwell in this place that does hold goodness\n IN SPITE of its\n political being as the United States of America\n and in spite of the legacy of\n my white European ancestors\n Like\n Share\n Comment"

4448,9y5O5Dx.jpg,"feeling furious\n 8 has\n I just dealt with the most brazen case of racism l've ever\n witnessed, and truth be told, I'm still furious and in shock\n While standing in line at the Louisville airport for food, l let a\n beautiful, extremely polite child (maybe 5 or 6 years old, flying\n solo) slide in front of me so I could help her with her money so\n she could get a snack\n This mouth breathing screechweasel behind me (dressed in\n dirty jeans, a NASCAR shirt and wearing a Donald J. Trump hat)\n loudly pipes up with ""Why d you let that little Iracial slur\n omitted] anywhere in front of you?""\n I was instantly livid (for those of you who know me, you know\n this results in an extremely cold, quiet kind of intensity born out\n of towering rage), and gave him several reasons why, and then\n told him he could take his hatred and ignorance somewhere\n else. then refused to allow him to approach the counter, and\n politely informed him that he should refrain from touching me\n when he reached out into my space\n I never touched him and\n never did anything except stand quietly and relaxed while\n facing him directly, but apparently, that was enough\n Since I wouldn't let the coward past me and he was afraid to\n actually touch me, all he did was stand there and scream for a\n bit, and then he left. The entire shop applauded when he turned\n around and stalked out, but prior to that, everyone pretended\n the conflict didn't exist. No one looked up; everyone acted like\n they had super important business on their phones. No one\n said anything, or tried to console the child\n It's a sad state of affairs when our culture has deteriorated to\n the point people will allow a little girl to be abused in front of\n them, with no comment. This literally happened today, an hour\n ago, in 2016. Speak up, people. Do something. If you're silent in\n the face of such blatant malevolence, you're part of the\n problem"

I have a few questions for you. I'm sure you've probably heard these a thousand times, but I wanted to\n hear your answers in a more relaxed, informal setting like this\n At Ellis Island was your family name anglicized to Trump from Trumpelstiltsken? And if so why are you ashamed of\n your German heritage?\n A lot has been made about how your hair looks like orange cotton candy. But I've only ever seen blue and pink\n cotton candy. Could you please pay a carny to make some orange cotton candy then hold it next to your head and\n send me a picture? Considering your level of wealth I don't think this is an unreasonable request.\n Who do you think would be better at hackysack: Gandalf the Grey or Holden Caulfield? This question is extremely\n time sensitive\n One time in sixth grade I went to church without noticing my pants were on backwards. And these were church\n pants, not sweatpants or anything, meaning I had to button them and zip up the fly while they were behind me\n without realizing anything was wrong. This one is not a question\n If you're elected president will you appoint Tom Brady to the supreme court s\n he can vacate his own suspension?\n Keep in mind that you will have to be elected before the start of the football season so the start will have to be\n delayed-most likely with some sort of black market weather machine\n Where were you on the morning of March 8th, 1999? I thought I might have seen you in my hallway but it may have\n been my dad. You don't look anything like my dad, but I don't know if maybe you looked like my dad on the morning\n of March 8th 1999.

First, the father elephant\n lets his daughter win hockey. The mother elephants comes in and emasculate him by saying she always wins. To make matters worst, she\n pushes him twice (domestic violence message) and he takes it while emasculating and complaining she never gets flowers. The daughter\n shows very little respect to his father where her boyfriend acts ""gay"" and hugs the father. Another creature comes in and says regarding\n relationships\n ""love them and leave them and take half of everything."" l was in complete shock\n What kind of message are they trying to give\n our children\n l notice this trend in most of Hollywood movies where im starting to ban my kids from watching most movies now. I have to watch\n the movie first cause l don't want my children to be damaged like so many children turn out to be in the west due to TV. lt's getting to the point\n where i'm want to pull my kids out of school cause the teachers think this kind of behaviour is acceptable who are teaching my children valves\n when go to work everyday. l pray to god that Trump wins cause he doesn't stand for this kind of bad morals in our country!

Then\n just a few minutes later it was my stop so I stand\n up to get off at the front of the bus\n and the dude gets up from the back and comes to stand directly behind me and tells\n the bus driver he's going to file a complaint about her for not making me move because\n was ""disturbing him."" And she was like ""Ok, sir."" And then scarily enough the guy gets\n off with me and is clearly following me, so lwalk super briskly to the building right next\n to the stop which l knew was a government building (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory\n Commission) and go up to the guard at the front desk and let him know l came in\n because a guy followed me off the bus. He was standing outside the building at the\n front door, peeking in for a moment and then he walked away. Ihave no idea what he\n was planning to do if he ever caught up to me, but thankfully l didn't find out\n My mom was on the phone with me through this whole thing it freaked her out, it\n freaked me out.

This is actually a subject for which I\n have strong feelings. As you said, I am a well educated guy with 4\n years of of studying sociology (as well as other majors) at Berkeley\n under my belt and l am pretty confident in my ability to speak on both\n my own life and my opinions on American society. Nevertheless, and I\n admit Ido not know Isa personally, but I do not have the inclination to\n engage on FB with someone who thinks the equivalent of ""I'm sorry\n that you're upset"" is an appropriate or mature response to my earlier\n comment, nor who thinks that being an ""a\n y"" of the gay community\n somehow exempts her absolutely unfounded and absurd assertion\n that a man like Putin, who thinks it's not only morally ok but entire\n legal to throw people in jail (or often times worse as they turn their\n back to very out and visible violence towards gay men and women) for\n even trying to promote LGBT rights, is at all a rational individual simply\n because she and Putin share a scientifically unfounded opinion on\n GMOS\n I have worked in politics and l have worked on the ground floor of\n activism. l have worked with immigrants and oppressed minorities.\n have worked with the far left and the far right. Ido not always agree\n with either side, and you will often see me make counter arguments\n against some of their strong opinions. But make no mistake that those\n counter opinions are not formed from ignorance, but from a full and\n loyal understanding of both their goals and the logic of their\n arguments\n The US is not a perfect country by a long shot. No country on this\n planet is and assertions that one country is better than the other is a\n theory in which l can easily poke holes in, with Russia being a prime\n example. Each country is flawed in their own way because people are\n just naturally prone to do stupid shit. However, I have great faith in the\n US system to constantly strive to be better because believe that even\n if the US was objectionably the perfect country on the planet, it would\n still try to be better. The US is an ongoing 240\n year experiment that\n ll never cease, which will always remain its greatest strength, and\n which forms the foundation of my confidence in it.\n Unlike Reply\n 2\n 11 hrs\n I meant it in only the most\n respectful way.

That said, I know Isa\n in fact she is family so l also know how passionate she is for the same\n values that you and I mostly share.\n She and come from a family/generational history of declining\n fortunes. Our adult lives have been about watching societal promises\n that our parents enjoyed disappear, things have not gotten better for\n many/most of those we have known. Instead family members have\n turned to ina ne ideologies--like gun worship. Itshakes our faith in our\n 240 year experiment. Like you though, l'm mostly a believer l know\n that in the aggregate things are improving but it is often difficult to\n ignore that which is right l front of your face...or those you care about\n Unlike Reply\n 2 11 hrs\n I love this discussion. To be clear: I have ZERO ""faith\n in the US system to constantly strive to be bette\n r"" on the metrics that\n are most important to me and my ability to be peaceful and happy.\n Which are really different that\n or Still I wish the best\n for you! Namaste*\n Like Reply\n 1 5 hrs\n I would never accuse you of\n sharing our rat race metrics\n But I am sure we are all on the same\n page in wanting equality and opportunity for a\n and a healthier\n happier world\n Like Reply\n 1 1 hr\n I agree with the spirit of what you say. And the goal of\n healthier and happier humans (that is what you meant, right). But. As l\n have nothing to lose\n and the more I travel am falling away from\n the western concept that ""equality"" (broad spectrum of potential\n definitions) and ""opportunity"" (ditto) increase proportionally with health\n and happiness. For example Thailand has the happiest culture l have\n encountered yet, relatively liberated sexually, et they are mostly\n poor, in a military dictatorship-with national health care. So.

5069,1-lb3Tiwt.jpg,"WHY VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP\n 1. Donald Trump is the only candidate who can turn things\n around for America and should be taken seriously!!!\n 2. He is immune to special interest lobbying because he has\n accepted no donations or special interest money. No other\n candidate can make this claim\n 3. He is an executive. The President of the United States is\n the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don't need a\n policy expert or a legislator we need someone who knows\n how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate\n who has a proven record as a successful executive on a\n large scale\n 4. He is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He\n may not always say it in the most polished way\n but our\n country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some\n straight forward honesty\n 5. He is decisive. As President every decision he makes\n would be in the best interest of the country. We hear about\n his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In\n each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he\n cut his losses. We need someone who will look at\n government programs realistically and if they are failures;\n will end the wasteful Washington spending\n 6. He is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked\n by the Washington establishment and the media\n and he\n has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to\n take charge and lead\n 7. He listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience\n gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and\n he responds without a teleprompter\n 8. His success is unmatched in the business world by all the\n others\n He attended one of the best business schools/ to make 10\n billion dollars\n 9. Having an IQ of 157, his knowledge of contracts and\n negotiating is brilliant/ internationally/ unparalleled. No one\n builds an international business empire the size of Trump's\n without being able to win at the negotiating table\n 10. He was popular in the Apprentice/ number\n 1# rated\n program 10 years running"
5070,2-4NHg0ne.jpg," 11. He wrote 10 best-selling books His book the Art of a\n deal [educational]\n 12. He owns and operates Miss Universe/ Miss America]\n beauty pageants\n 13. He's doing business worldwide therefore his experience\n is desirable/ knows cultures/international taxes/ pricing/\n shipping unions/ regulations/ contracts/ business/\n practices suppliers/ safety rules/ types of workers\n 14. He's into construction, media, manufacturing, travel and\n publishing\n 15. He's a job producer/ just for the records/ most of his\n CEO's are women yes they make more than the men/\n creditability counts\n 16. He gives millions to charities\n 17. He understands currencies/ money exchanges/ inflation,\n deflation worldwide wages\n 18. His tax program 0-10-15-25 is simple\n 19. His universal interstate medical/ insurance program is\n very realistic/ competition\n 20. He has a good five point immigration program\n 21. He's pro military & Vet's [improve VA hospital/carel Take\n ISIS oil fields to pay Vets\n 22. He wants to seal off the boarder [build that wall] He's\n built a 96 story building/ he thinks that's harder than\n constructing a wall. He understands that a nation without\n borders, language and laws is not a nation\n 23. He's anti-Iran deal pro-Israel. He says it states we have\n to protect Iran if Israel attacks [lran keeps saying they are\n going to wipe Israel and us off of\n the mapl\n 24. His pro Christmas stance is anti [political correct]\n 25. He also realizes that our nation is being trashed\n worldwide and speaks up about it\n 26. He recognizes the China money manipulation policy\n which is anti-USA\n 27. He says that Japan's tariff on US goods [one way deal\n making]\n 28. He wants to put a tariff on Mexican goods/ all traffic/ cut\n off aid\n 29. Remember when Trump said; we protect Saudi Arabia\n therefore they must pay"
5071,3-MfAKZOk.jpg," 30. We fought and spend billions in Afghanistan to help\n those people and China is mining their minerals because the\n Obama administration is incompetent/ can't win at\n negotiating/ stupid leaders\n 1. He's warning America of [Poisons vaccines] and the\n dangers\n 32. He wants a high tech military/ a world class military/\n hardware/ hacking/ security [too good to faill\n 33. He realizes we have a Muslin problem in this nation\n 4. He thinks Obama's birth certificate is a fraud check out\n his SS#, no draft card/ old pass port/ E-verification status,\n school records [remember his dad isn't American therefore\n he isn't qualified for the office he's inl\n 35. He will work for a $1 per year salary, give the rest to\n charity and not accept the pension after presidency if\n elected\n SUMMARY\n Like him or not, agree with him or not, it doesn't matter. So\n far Trump is the only candidate who has shown that he ""can\n up-set the apple-cart"" and make things happen and he is\n exactly what America needs at this point in time! Everybody\n should do their homework on the candidates. We must not\n listen to the ""political media'. They are not going to tell you\n the truth! They have a way of twisting words for their own\n story and agenda! There is an important choice that each\n voter has to make. Either you cast your vote for another\n puppet candidate"" and support business as usual in\n II\n Washington again or support Donald Trump and HELP\n MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!\n February 29 Like\n 327"

SO fuck them. Any centipede any time wants to\n challenge what I'm saying go for it, it's all the truth though\n Donald Trump was sued in the 1973 for housing discrimination\n As part of his plea deal he admitted to creating a business policy in which black applicants to his housing bloc were\n marked with a 'C' for colored. After that again in 1978 he was sued because he would not allow colored folk to inspect\n homes, stating they were filled when there were openings\n n 1992 his casino lost a workplace discrimination lawsuit, to the tune of $200,000 The decision was upheld during\n appeals\n ""And isn't it funny. I've go\n black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guy\n counting my\n money! I hate it,"" O'Donnell recalled saying. ""The only kind\n Trump of people\n I want counting my money are\n short guys that wear yarmulkes every day\n ""I think the guy is lazy,"" Trump said of a black employee, according to O'Donnell. And it's probably not his\n fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is\n I believe that. It's not anything they can contr\n Totally not racist right? Part of the transcripts of that case, good times\n I'll pretend that the Birther Movement wasn't racially motivated and move on\n I'm probably talking to a bri\n all and\n am about to get banned again anyway\n He still believes he was right about the Central Park 5\n These were 5 black men convicted of the rape and murder of a woman in central park. Years later DNA evidence\n overturned the conviction. Donald Trump took out full page ads calling for the return of lynching and condemning\n them\n The fact he st\n maintains they are guilty after DNA proof is\n concerning\n ove the desperation in your memes about how not racist you a\n are, despite having a completely racist ideology.\n his\n this is just the tip of the iceberg\n his is the shit I can remember after a lifetime of growing up watching the\n overgrown toupee with tiny hands at his antics. He's a racist, ignorant, loudmouth just like his supporters\n Other Donald Trump myths:\n 1) He's a self made man. That's laughable really. He's a trust fund baby who inherited N$100m\n when daddy died\n and before that daddy invested in his failed business ventures\n 2) He's successfu\n The Donald would have made more money had he deposited his money in an escrow account that\n matured at standard market rates\n of you because edumacation isn't a strong suit here, but basically.\n all of\n ost a\n the Donald's 'success\n s nothing compared to how successful he'd be if he'd just\n done nothing.

I put on 50lbs. (That's\n not a super heavy squat until you realize that we can do over 100 reps with little to no\n rest). FT racked up 30lbs. I could actually see his genitalia shrinking when he looked\n over and saw my weight\n A Word about me and squatin\n been doing squats for\n over 15 years. I am good at them. My form is beyond reproach. Not so for FT who had\n bad form and a hard time towards the end of the song. No sweat, everyone is at a\n different level. Except he keeps looking over at me. So I keep smiling back in a ""I'm\n tolerating you, you creepy fucker"" kind of way. As soon as the track is over while I'm\n trying to rack my weight for the chest track FT walks over and says:\n ""You have to be careful when you're just starting a workout program, you might think\n that you can lift that much weight but you're going to be sore tomorrow\n Nope, didn't kick him in the nads. Wanted to, but didn't. I smiled, e-v-e-r so tolerantly\n and said ""I've got it, thanks""\n Short story long, I continued to lift more than him, he continued to give me advice\n about being a beginner exerciser. Then came the lunge track. I rack 40lbs. He racks\n 50. FIFTY!!!! What was he thinking? If he can barely squat 30 with both legs how in\n hetero HELL is he going to lunge 50 with one leg. Whatever. He struggles, almost falls\n over a couple of times and then lowers his weight. HA! I say again HA!!!!\n At the end of the class we do the shoulder workout, the end of which is push ups\n Guess which one of us does them bitch-style (on the knees). Oh, that would be FT. I\n normally do a combination of full and bitch-style push ups but when I saw him start\n off on his knees I resolved that they would take me away in an ambulance with both\n arms dislocated before I would drop down to my knees\n The moral of the story: Icalled him Fucktard because he is not even fit to be the hat\n on my ass!\n Reply"

5465,RR4AWKX.png,"178 points\n 17\n nutes ago\n John Oliver behaves like a hyper child, smothered by his own smug eagerness to sound superior to everyone else.\n Pandering to the brainwashed masses that want exactly this. Distilled to its purest form. Critical thinking be damned\n Not unlike some of the shit from the Right, JO is the poor man's John Stewart. It's okay to have a laugh over reality. I\n respect many a comedian and thier work, like Louis CK (fairly self aware of his bigotry), but damn the bigotry is deep\n We actually live in a culture where if someone like Louis CK said anything nice about Steven Hawking, his career would\n be over. But if they don't participate in current events somehow, they would become irrelevant. Ain't that some shit\n They are having serious trouble identifying true hypocrisy. Fear of losing their position in life, no matter how self\n oathing it is. I miss George Carlin. I hope South Park continues to be a voice of reason. Hell, even Portlandia. People\n take comedy damn seriously and unfortunately JO is SM tabloid trash disguised as higher brow. John Oliver is the\n primary source of American news for edgy liberals/progressives in the western world. Like 90\n of his audience on\n youtube are millennial foreigners. Everything they know about the elections, and other issues comes from this man\n Please deport him, or at least keep him off the air. At least Jon Leibowitz is off the air forever. John Oliver is using his\n millennial hipster writers to come up with creative ways to call someone a white male again? Gimme a fuckin break\n Get this loser off the air.\n Jon Stewart never had one of his clips be 50% dislikes on Youtube. This guy panders to his\n audience harder than fuckin Maher and that's saying a lot. So far the new season of Real Time has been downright\n awful, even by its usual standards. I don't like Maher but I watch Real Time to get perspectives from the other side\n and the show is pretty much the only platform with a significant degree of constructive discourse. This new season has\n been mostly stacked liberal panels and thus far every conservative panel member has been vehemently anti-Trump\n Have made no mention of the violent\n protesters and continue to trope the usual liberal victim talking points. I don't\n think that John Oliver is condoning online harassment in the first image\n rather, I think he's just saying that\n if you\n become a world leader, the reality is that you will be harassed. Not that you should be harassed or you deserve to be\n harassed, but\n that it will happen. I'd respect him a bit if he went after Hillary even a little. He's the perfect Bernie\n cuck, loves his socialist politics but is too afraid of upsetting his masters or Twitter to go after her. A vote for Hillary is\n a vote for genocide in Syria, oppression in Egypt, terrorists in Libya and the rest of North Africa, Russian aggression in\n Europe, war crimes in Yemen and drone strikes and instability throughout the middle East. She was the chief architect\n f Obama's failed foreign policy, but all the left wants us to talk about is how we are finally gonna get Cuban rum and\n cigars. I\n it, admit I liked the guy's humor if you put the politics of it aside (and you should, it's a fucking comedy\n show not an intellectual debating show. I sadly had not seen the episode where he said that second quote and now\n that I have\n what the fuck. Even for the entertainment value I refuse to give this fuckface more views.

Muslims aren't trying to control the\n UK, staying in the EU won't result in ""handing the country"" over to Muslims. WTF is wrong with you people?\n Followers of Islam, as well as any religion in general, is never black and white. It's not like every adherent to every\n religion believes in what the religion does 100%. I'm Jewish, and I don't believe women should be excluded from\n prayer, or that homosexuality is abhorrent. There are plenty, plenty, of Muslims who condemn rape, robbery, and\n delegitimization of women's rights in the name of religion\n How about instead of pretending you know everything, you stop listening to propgranda and read the New York Times\n or something\n permalink save parent edit disable inbox replies delete reply"

The article is full of made-up information and a lot, a LOT of links to anti-Islam\n websites. Aside from the article, the website is clearly not a viable source of information. The banner for the website\n shows people covered in blood and the wreckage from 9\n Here are actual headlines from other articles this website\n has published\n ""Source: Failed President Obama the Worst Economic President Since the Great Depression Ready to\n ""Explode"" onto 2016 Campaign Trail""\n Breaking Poll: Half of Voters Believe Crooked Hillary Broke the Law with her Private Email Server""\n ""AZ MEASLES OUTBREAK LINKED TO IMMIGRANT SHELTER: Patients Exposed Church Assemblies, Graduation,\n Denny's, Safeway and Casino""\n http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2015/06/23/nationwide-po\n muslims-shows-thousands-support\n shariah-jihad\n Links from the sidebar include ""National Security Summits\n ""Star Spangled Sharia\n The Red-Green Axis\n ""Ikhwan in\n America\n See No Sharia\n and ""Gulen and the Gulenist Movement""\n Islam is not a religion\n Actually, it is a religion\n It is fascism, violence, perversion, misogyny and ""other hate"" sprinkled with religion\n Yeah, so is Christianity and Judaism.

Hate gays, keep women in the home, and start wars if people\n don't worship the God of Israel, or Allah as they call Him\n Over rep representation just means they commit the crimes more than normal humans\n Uh, no it doesn't. Dictionary.com defines overrepresentation as: to give too much representation to; disproportionally\n high\n For instance raping non Muslims/taking them for sex slaves/fucking children are all Muslim crimes when committed\n by Muslims if they are doing so because Sharia/Muslim beliefs condone them\n Actually, that's a misconception.

Did you just warg like 6 different conversations from eight peoples minds\n into one? What the actual FUCK does the Third Reich have anything to do with the UK leaving the EU? I'm pretty\n sure Germany has moved past massacring 11 million people more than 70 million years ago, hell it wasn't even that\n guilty when it began having international relations with Israel\n because not allowing your daughters to be raped and your sons to be murdered by kebab is ""racist""\n WHO HAS BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THE WORLD WORKS?\n If you are a Jew who wants kebab in your neighborhood I honestly don't even know what to say.

STOP PRETENDING LIKE YOU KNOW\n EVERYTHING. Muslims and Jews get along pretty well GLOBALLY, with the exception of the Mid East. Also, don't give\n me your shit about ""DUUUUR BUT THE QURAN SAYS JEWS ARE ALLAH'S ENEMIES\n 1"" because it doesn't. The hadith\n say that, and compared to the Quran they are SHIT. Hadith are largely fabricated and shouldn't be venerated, so go\n to hell\n Islam has bloody borders\n So does the Mongol people. How about you go up all the millions of descendants from the women Genghis Khan raped\n and tell them they're the reason Britain's gone to shit?\n So does America, why don't you bitch slap all 300 million Americans and call them ""Native killers?\n So are Christians, how over 2000 years have killed millions and millions and millions of Jews, Muslims, Buddhists,\n animists, Wiccans, pagans, etc, a\n in the name of God\n Anywhere Islam comes into contact with civilized human beings there is death\n Russia seems to be doing fine, without\n Islamic and Byzantinian cultural diffusion it would've fell to the Golden Horde\n You read a fucking history book\n peoples conquered by Islam dont fair well\n The Ottoman Empire lasted\n for 700 years, was never in a war, was a world superpower, and despite being ran by\n Muslims was one of the most prosperous countries that ever existed"

For a\n intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond\n dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies\n We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you al\n seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So\n ask of you to mustard up a\n the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there\n Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on\n your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and\n even though you are having a feel day with this\n am here to bring you back into reality.\n have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because\n cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants\n hen it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness\n You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and\n command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass\n stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once.\n It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to\n swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion\n through denial and error but I swear on my mothers mating name that when you put the\n petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake"

Then he stated after starting his job, he went\n back to school\n and he was bitching cause his job was upset he was late,\n but it was due to classes and they should understand. felt so sorry for the\n ESC man he was talking to, who tried hard to explain why the boy wasnt\n entitled to unemployment after 12 weeks, and that he should have taken\n day classes and not night ones so he wouldnt be late for work.\n The boy then stated\n can not wait for Hillary to win. She will give me my\n unemployment What an idiot.\n Today we went out to get our laundry done. We always take a radio with\n us. Today I had the station on a conservative talk show.

There are not institutions in place designed to\n give us OUR choices about OUR bodies. There ARE institutions in\n place designed to systematically incarcerate women of color for non\n violent crimes perpetrated by the same systems of cyclical poverty and\n separate them from their children, creating a prison-industrial complex\n that profits from human suffering and institutionalized sexual abuse,\n followed by the sale of their children to families with more privilege\n There arentsystems in place to ensure l get paid the same amount for\n the work l do.

6426,IYJZnEz.png,"I understand that I have a very limited view of the military from the inside. Three months in an Army TRADOC\n environment is nowhere close to representing the ""real military."" I won't be presumptuous and claim to know more\n than what I really do\n Right now, I am speaking from the point of view of a\n civilian: the people you swore an oath to defend. A millennial\n male, not yet 25 years old, who has lived in both New York City and the rural west. I have been to college, and wi\n continue my studies this fal\n semester. I believe that my views represent those of the average American young adult\n the voters, politicians, and citizens of\n the future\n When the average educated young adult thinks about the military, certain issues pop up immediately. One issue that\n has been making headlines for some time is the huge crisis of sexual assault within our armed forces\n military times.com/story/military/pentago\n 155\n When a nistic person who follows the news sees that this has been a problem for a very long time, and no\n progress is being made, he or she starts to ask questions about how much the military really cares for the well being\n of women in uniform. From my brief experience with the army, the SHARP program is treated like a joke. Nobody\n from the privates all the way up the chain of command, seems to actually give a shit about stopping sexual\n harassment and assault\n The word ""SHARP"" is treated like a joke, a mockery. And even though my experience is very\n imited, there documented evidence that sexual assault in the ""real army"" is being covered up at the highest levels\n http://warincontext.org/2013/02/27/inside-the-u-s-militarys-culture-of-sex-abuse-denial-and-cover-up/\n Another thing which a wel\n nformed person notices about the armed forces is that the racial\n religious, and political\n demographics of the military are not representative of the country. http:\n om/us-military-i\n representative-of-country- 2014-7 http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/07/the-widening-gap-between\n 158/ The south is way overrepresented in enlistment numbers. The military is far more\n republican and conservative than the public as a whole. The problem with this is manyfold. First off, the vast majority\n of the country's educated population, the thinkers and leaders of the future, come from the northeast. In contrast, the\n ess educated, more ignorant south makes up the majority of the armed forces, placing the military years behind the\n rest of the country in terms of social attitudes and progress. Also, since conservatives and the republican party are\n dying out, htt\n the cal views held by the\n majority of the military, which are already the minority in the public as a whole, will become even less representative\n of the country as a whole. A smart, educated citizen can draw no other conclusion than the fact that the military does\n not represent the people, but is an antiquated, regressive institution whose members are far too reactionary, and far\n too entrenched in the uneducated, bigoted ways of the south from where most of its members come\n Is it any wonder that fewer and fewer young americans, especially those who are we\n educated and come from modern\n and progressive regions of the country, are enlisting in the armed forces? http\n real-problem-fewer-americans-are-joining/\n I think not. The modern generation of educated young adults, the future of\n this country, is tired of the misogyny, the reactionary ideals, and the misguided political beliefs of the average service\n member\n generation is more kind, more empathetic than any previous generations\n http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/fashion/the-m\n ennials-are-generation-nice. html? r 0\n https://www\n nkedin.com/pulse/201406241 32305-171417-why-m\n ennials will-be-more-empathetic-leaders My\n generation is more educated than any previous generations: http\n culture/2015/08/m\n All of these stand in direct contrast to the\n most\n far-right politics, violent purpose, and extreme sociopathy so prevalent in our redneck dominated armed forces. You\n can try to deny it or bury your head in the sand as much as you want.

The chefs hat. Why IS It shaped like a\n mushroom cloud? Because they both sure can cook. And\n why is a mushroom cloud shaped like a mushroom? Not\n many people know this, but out in the forest, right where\n every mushroom grows, there used to be a tiny Japanese\n city, so tiny that even David the Gnome could commit\n accidental genocide just by taking a poop without looking\n Ironically, Gnome Poop is highly sought after in Japan\n because of its mystical properties and because it tastes\n good on sushi, for people who cant handle wasabi\n Here in America, Gnome Poops mystique is somewhat\n overshadowed by that of Unicorn\n Seed! the hip new soda\n pop that all the kids are guzzling on the street corners. Its\n popularity has been hugely fostered by product placement\n in popular films. For instance, in the film Muscular Hooker\n 2, Will Smiths character takes a dramatically-framed swig of\n Unicorn Seed! and then suddenly grows a CGI erection which\n extends into infinity, and then Will Smiths mind explodes\n and the movie ends\n For that scene alone, Roger Ebert gives the film 3 and a half\n stars. Not many people know this, but movie critics have a\n finite amount of stars they can award in their lifetime. They\n are often kept in a vault, heavily secured to prevent a senile\n Scrooge McDuck from wandering in, mistaking the stars for\n gold coins, and swimming in them. This is for Scrooges own\n protection, as the stars have sharp edges and would lacerate\n his body into a bloody feathered pulp"

As for Scrooge McDucks body, it will be jerked and\n eaten, as per Scottish tradition\n Indeed, cannibalism of the dead is a cherished custom in\n Scotland.

But no!\n Once your parents are dead, theres nothing to stop you from\n eating nothing but sweets, as children are wont to do. And\n when your baby teeth have rotted away, there will be no adult\n teeth to take their place. Toothless, stupid, and unkissed by\n the spirits of puberty, you will be banished from Scotland\n to the only place in this World Where an awkward man-child\n such as yourself can ever hope to be accepted- lreland\n You will live as a leprechaun. You will don a false beard and\n a green bowler and stand on the streets jabbering about a\n nonexistent pot of gold. When darkness falls, you will sleep\n in an alley on a bed of night soil, clutching a potato, which\n will be your surrogate mother. If you are found by leprechaun\n poachers, your only hope for escape is to mesmerize them\n With a sprightly leprechaun Jig, and then stab their eyes out\n with your leprechaun stiletto. Then you must run away- to\n find another Irish hamlet, and the cycle will repeat forever\n until one of three things happens: 1. The poachers get too\n smart for you. 2. You starve to death. 3.

 Like an Apple Watch Only Not
By Ethan on January 30, 2015

Verified Purchase

  

I've always wanted a calculator watch. Now that
I'm pushing 30, | felt that I'm an adult and | can do
what | want and | want to buy a calculator watch,
dammit. Yeah, | said it. You're not my mom. Deal
with it.

It's great. It has dual time, a stopwatch, alarm, tells
the date and day of the week, AND A FRIGGIN'
CALCULATOR. If you wear it tightly enough, you
can feel your pulse. So it's like an Apple Watch
only it costs under $20, has a 3 year
manufacturer's warranty, and the battery lasts five
years. Doesn't send text messages, but you can
write such words as 'BOOBS', 'BOOBIES',
‘BOOBLESS', 'BEES', and 'SHOE'. So if you're a man
of few words and your friend is right next to you,
it's basically the same as iMessage.

LET'S FUCKING FRISBEE (anywhere in the Noog)

 

No frisbee golf, no ultimate. Don't care what race or gender you are. Not trying to jack off or fuck anyone. All I wanna do is toss a goddamned frisbee at you, and

you throw it back. I don't care if you're any good. Let's just try this shit. Yes, I am awesome at frisbee throwing and catching (especially for a man of my portly
stature), but don't let that intimidate you. Embrace my awesome. Have a drink from my flask. Let's do this shit.

do NOT contact me with unsolicited sewices or offers
